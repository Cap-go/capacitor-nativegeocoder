# Example App for `@capgo/nativegeocoder`

This Vite project links directly to the local plugin source so you can exercise the native APIs while developing.

## Actions in this playground

- **Forward geocode** – Converts an address into coordinates. Provide a Google Maps API key when running on web.
- **Reverse geocode** – Converts latitude/longitude into an address.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Add native shells with `npx cap add ios` or `npx cap add android` from this folder to try behaviour on device or simulator.
